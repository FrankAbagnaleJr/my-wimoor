```java

import com.amazon.spapi.uploads.*;
import com.amazon.spapi.uploads.auth.*;
import com.amazon.spapi.model.uploads.*;
import com.amazon.spapi.uploads.api.UploadsApi;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.*;

public class UploadsApiExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        UploadsApi apiInstance = new UploadsApi();
        List<String> marketplaceIds = Arrays.asList("marketplaceIds_example"); // List<String> | A list of marketplace identifiers. This specifies the marketplaces where the upload will be available. Only one marketplace can be specified.
        String contentMD5 = "contentMD5_example"; // String | An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
        String resource = "resource_example"; // String | The URL of the resource for the upload destination that you are creating. For example, to create an upload destination for a Buyer-Seller Messaging message, the {resource} would be /messaging and the path would be  /uploads/v1/uploadDestinations/messaging
        String contentType = "contentType_example"; // String | The content type of the file to be uploaded.
        try {
            CreateUploadDestinationResponse result = apiInstance.createUploadDestinationForResource(marketplaceIds, contentMD5, resource, contentType);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (ApiException e) {
            System.err.println("Exception when calling UploadsApi#createUploadDestinationForResource");
